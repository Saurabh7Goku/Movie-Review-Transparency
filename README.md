# Movie-Review-Transparency
## Overview  If we are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can we trust online reviews and ratings? **Especially** if the same company showing the rating **also** makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?  


## Goal: Our goal is to check data based off the 538 article and see if you reach a similar conclusion. We will need to use your pandas and visualization skills to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.**
